# minlab
A simple web application targetting small-sized medical labs in Egypt
The idea was to create one free online portal for those medical labs to use, instead of buying expensive software.

The project was aiming at doing smart analysis on data collected from those small labs as well to help government to spot areas where certain diseases are common.
